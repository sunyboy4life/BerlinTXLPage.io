<ol>
    <li>Navbar with Map View as the Homepage</li>
</ol>
<figure>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunyboy4life/BerlinTXLPage.io/main/assets/user/Bild10.png" width="700" alt="Homepage Design" />    
    <figcaption><strong>FIGURE 10:</strong> The first design for the homepage</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The idea was to create a homepage with a prominent interactive map view. Various elements could be accessed through a navigation bar (Navbar). Alternatively, upon selecting a building, the relevant information could appear on the page below the map.</p>

<p>2. Dashboard</p>
<p>The second option was a dashboard where all elements are directly presented, with the map still being prominent. All elements should interact with each other, particularly in terms of their connections. The dashboard allowed displaying all components with just one click. The only adjustable parameter was the timeframe. Interaction between elements was facilitated through selecting the timeframe and the building.</p>
