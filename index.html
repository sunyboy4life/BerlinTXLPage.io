The focus is on the reasons for changes, why certain aspects remained unchanged, and the advantages and disadvantages of specific features.</p>

<h4>The first Ideas:</h4>
<p>The initial considerations regarding the representation of features led to two main options:</p>

<p>1. Navbar with Map View as the Homepage</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunyboy4life/BerlinTXLPage.io/main/assets/user/Bild10.png" width="700" alt="Homepage Design" />    
    <figcaption><strong>FIGURE 10:</strong> The first design for the homepage</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The idea was to create a homepage with a prominent interactive map view. Various elements could be accessed through a navigation bar (Navbar). Alternatively, upon selecting a building, the relevant information could appear on the page below the map.</p>

<p>2. Dashboard</p>
<p>The second option was a dashboard where all elements are directly presented, with the map still being prominent. All elements should interact with each other, particularly in terms of their connections. The dashboard allowed displaying all components with just one click. The only adjustable parameter was the timeframe. Interaction between elements was facilitated through selecting the timeframe and the building or buildings.</p>

    </tr>
</table>

<h4>Commitment to one of the two options</h4>
<p>The decision to commit to a dashboard view was made because this option offered several advantages: Comprehensive representation, Reduction of representations, and Connection of elements. Therefore, committing to a dashboard view was a strategic decision to create a comprehensive, well-connected, and easily understandable visualization. This not only enhanced user-friendliness but also facilitated a more effective analysis of interactions and connections between different elements of the system.</p>

<h3>Final Product</h3>

<p>In this section, we will now delve into our final product. However, before we dive into the details, we would like to highlight the last adjustments that have further improved our product.</p>

<p>The first significant adjustment concerns the visualization of our data. Originally, a classic Pie Chart was planned, but after careful consideration, we opted for a Sunburst Chart. The Sunburst not only provides an aesthetically pleasing representation but also enables a deeper analysis and understanding of our data. The hierarchical structure of the Sunburst allows us to divide complex data into clearly structured segments, thus conveying relationships in an intuitive manner. This makes the Sunburst Chart an extremely effective visualization method that helps our users quickly identify relevant patterns and trends.</p>

<p>The second adjustment concerns the selection of time periods. Originally, a more complex selection process was planned, but we ultimately opted for a simple Datepicker. Why? A Datepicker provides a user-friendly and straightforward way to select the desired time frame. Through direct interaction with the calendar, users can quickly and precisely set their desired time frame without having to deal with complicated settings. This simplicity significantly enhances the user experience and makes navigating through the data a pleasant and efficient task.</p>

<p>The third adjustment is a new color scheme. We have developed our product with special care to ensure that not only the design, but also all elements harmonize well with the color scheme. This allowed us to achieve a harmonious overall picture on the dashboard.</p>

<h4>Sunburst Chart:</h4>
<p>In our view, the Sunburst Chart was the best way to illustrate the consumption of individual buildings and simultaneously show how much energy the respective heat meters in these buildings consume. Through the radial arrangement of the Sunburst Chart, we not only gain an overview of total consumption but also detailed insights into the hierarchy of consumption data. Each ring represents a level of consumption, ranging from total consumption figures to the specific consumption values of individual heat meters in the respective buildings. This hierarchical representation enables us to identify patterns and trends at a glance and identify relationships between the consumption values of buildings and individual heat meters. In this way, we can make informed decisions to effectively optimize energy consumption and efficiently utilize resources.</p>

<h4>Line Chart & Small Multiples:</h4>
    
<p>Line charts are a proven tool for representing data over time. They show trends and patterns in a clear and easily understandable manner. But what are Small Multiples? In our context the Small Multiples display all heat meters in a compact form, with the performance of each meter shown. This representation allows us to obtain a comprehensive overview of the entire data landscape without losing sight of the details. The Small Multiples are dynamically adjusted when a building is selected on the map. In this case, the corresponding line charts of the heat meters in this building are highlighted with a frame, supporting the analysis of the users. Through both the line chart and the Small Multiples, you have the opportunity to select and deselect heat meters as desired. This allows for a tailored analysis and targeted examination of specific data points. If no building is selected, all heat meters are displayed in the large line chart. Depending on the selection, the corresponding meters are then displayed, ensuring a flexible and customizable visualization.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>The final implementation reflects a comprehensive and user-friendly approach to visualizing energy consumption at Berlin-Tegel Airport. By committing to a dashboard design, we've created a platform that allows for detailed analysis while being accessible to various user groups. The use of Figma facilitated a collaborative design process, enabling us to refine our ideas and produce a visualization tool that meets our objectives of providing insightful, real-time data analysis in an interactive and engaging manner.</p>

<p><strong>Map</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Map</strong> is based on Mapbox and displays the buildings of the Berlin TXL Airport along with the corresponding heat meters for each building. Users can select either a building or individual heat meters to view specific data related to energy consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Sunburst Chart</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Sunburst Chart</strong> visualizes the total consumed energy value per building. It comprises two layers: the inner circle shows the percentage value of the building's total energy consumption, and the outer circle represents individual meters associated with the buildings, allowing for a detailed breakdown of energy usage.</p>

<p><strong>Info Field</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Info Field</strong> provides a general overview when no selection is made, detailing the number of buildings and heat meters present. Hovering over a building on the map updates this field with information about the selected building and its energy consumption. Similarly, hovering over a Small Multiple displays detailed data for the selected heat meter, including its location within the building.</p>

<p><strong>Small Multiples</strong></p>
<p><strong>Small Multiples</strong> display all heat meters in small, individual diagrams. This visualization shows the cumulative value of energy consumption, providing an overview at a glance. Users can select specific heat meters for a more detailed view.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed Line Diagram</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Detailed Line Diagram</strong> offers an in-depth view of energy consumption over a selected period for a heat meter. It displays all selected heat meters on the dashboard, enabling a comprehensive analysis of energy usage trends and comparisons across different meters.</p>
