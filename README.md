**What is Figma?**
Figma is a collaborative online design tool that allows teams to work together on the creation of graphics, user interfaces, and prototypes. It provides features for design, real-time editing, commenting, and prototyping. This makes it particularly effective for designing digital products and collaborating in distributed teams. For us, Figma has proven to be an indispensable tool for design exploration, and in this context, we now look at the individual process stages in which we have used it. The focus is on the reasons for changes, why certain aspects remained unchanged, and the advantages and disadvantages of specific features.

Analyzing the functions of Figma reveals clear pros and cons. The collaboration capabilities and real-time editing enhance efficiency and the exchange of ideas but may also lead to potential conflicts or uncertainties. By examining the reasons for changes, the persistence of certain aspects, and analyzing the pros and cons, we were able to create a balanced and effective design process that meets the requirements and expectations. Our product went through various design processes. Some elements remained unchanged throughout the process as they proved to be particularly effective or aesthetically pleasing, while other elements were carefully reconsidered, either discarded or adjusted.

**The first Ideas:**
The initial considerations regarding the representation of features led to two main options. The uncertainty about which option was the best determined the beginning of the design process. Now, let's delve into the details of these two options:

1. Navbar with Map View as the Homepage

<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/sunyboy4life/BerlinTXLPage.io/blob/main/assets/user/Bild10.png" width="700" />    
  <figcaption><b>FIGURE 10:</b> The first design for the homepage</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

The idea was to create a homepage with a prominent interactive map view. Various elements could be accessed through a navigation bar (Navbar). Alternatively, upon selecting a building, the relevant information could appear on the page below the map. The option of a login was considered but dismissed at this point, as it was not intended to display individual personal data.

<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/sunyboy4life/BerlinTXLPage.io/blob/main/assets/user/Bild11.png" width="700" />    
  <figcaption><b>FIGURE 11:</b> Dashboard design</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

The second option was a dashboard where all elements are directly presented, with the map still being prominent. All elements should interact with each other, particularly in terms of their connections. The dashboard allowed displaying all components with just one click. The only adjustable parameter was the timeframe. Interaction between elements was facilitated through selecting the timeframe and the building.

In addition to these considerations, the decision was made to use "Small Multiples" to represent the energy consumption of heat meters (WMZ) individually or collectively. Small Multiples are a visualization technique where multiple small graphics of the same chart are arranged in a matrix, allowing for quick and effective comparisons.

In the top right of the dashboard, the power of each WMZ in the building is depicted. This decision was made to enable a detailed yet comprehensive visualization of energy consumption.

<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/sunyboy4life/BerlinTXLPage.io/blob/main/assets/user/Bild12.png" width="700" />    
  <figcaption><b>FIGURE 12:</b> This illustration showcases the map view of HeatHub TXL, with interactive clickable buildings.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>


With the map, users have the option to click on specific buildings to access detailed information about that particular building and the heat meters located within it, along with their respective values. The map facilitates targeted selection and analysis.
<p></p>

**Commitment to one of the two options**

The decision to commit to a dashboard view was made because this option offered several advantages:

1. Comprehensive representation:
All elements were presented on a single screen, providing a holistic overview. This simplified the grasp and interpretation of information, eliminating the need to switch between different pages.
<p></p>
2. Reduction of representations:
Compared to multiple pages with different representations, the dashboard efficiently combined all relevant information on one surface. This promoted a clear and compact presentation without information overload.
<p></p>
3. Connection of elements:
Opting for the dashboard allowed for the connection of various elements. These connections reflected the interactions and linkages between the elements, enabling a more precise representation of relationships.
<p></p>
Therefore, committing to a dashboard view was a strategic decision to create a comprehensive, well-connected, and easily understandable visualization. This not only enhanced user-friendliness but also facilitated a more effective analysis of interactions and connections between different elements of the system.

  <figcaption><b>FIGURE 13:</b> Changed representation of the Heat Meters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

**Change in the representation of the consumed energy of the Heat Meters**
For the following reasons, we opted for a Pie Chart to represent the consumed energy of the Heat Meters.

1. Flexibility in the number of Heat Meters (HM):
A Pie Chart provides the flexibility to adjust the number of displayed HMs. With a high number of HMs, it can be challenging to accommodate them in other visualizations. The Pie Chart allows for a clear and compact presentation of this information, regardless of the quantity of displayed HMs.
<p></p>
2. Aesthetic and clear presentation:
The round shape of the Pie Chart offers an aesthetic representation while maintaining a clear and easily understandable presentation of the data. This visual component can enhance the user experience and facilitate data interpretation.
<p></p>
The decision for a Pie Chart in the top right corner added an additional dimension to the overall presentation, allowing for a flexible, clear presentation of relevant information about the Power of each HM.
<p></p>

**Addition of an information field and enlargement of the map**
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/sunyboy4life/BerlinTXLPage.io/blob/main/assets/user/Bild14.png" width="700" />    
  <figcaption><b>FIGURE 14:</b> Adding information-field and navigation-bar</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

In the early phase of the design process, the exact representation of information was not yet finalized. However, from the outset, a goal was set to provide users with the ability to access detailed information about the displayed values. This could be achieved by placing the Pie Chart in the top right corner, contributing to the enhancement of the main visualization. For this reason, the idea of an adaptive information field was considered.
<p></p>
In addition, the decision was made to enlarge the map itself to ensure it takes a prominent place. To create space and improve user-friendliness, the date picker was minimized. Simultaneously, a navbar was added at the top, including the date picker, the time range picker, and an info button providing general information about the Heat Meters (HMs).
<p></p>
The interaction between the date picker and the time range picker was strategically designed. The time range picker determines the period for which the data should be displayed (Day, 1 Week, 2 Weeks, 1 Month), while the date picker sets the starting date for retrospective analysis. For example, if two weeks are selected with a start date of February 14th, the data displayed will cover the period from February 1st to February 14th.
<p></p>
This integration allowed precise control over the displayed timeframe and ensured effective and user-friendly interaction with the information on the map. The info button complemented this functionality by providing general information about the HMs, offering users comprehensive context.

**New Color Scheme**
A unified color scheme has been introduced to make the entire dashboard more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing. This color scheme is applied to various elements such as backgrounds, buttons, text, and charts. The harmony in color design contributes to a pleasant user experience and enhances visual consistency.
Additionally, it now also depicts which buildings have been selected.
