The **HeatHub** Dashboard features an interactive map with 3D visualization for a total of 17 buildings on the Berlin TXL site equipped with heat meters. The map allows for detailed monitoring of heat consumption values at the building level. Mini-charts provide precise information, while large visualizations offer a quick and comprehensive overview. A pie chart displays the average energy consumption across all buildings. This intuitive platform provides both detailed insights and a comprehensive overview of heat consumption on the Berlin TXL site.

### Our Goals:
The "HeatHub TXL" project aims for precise data capture and analysis of energy consumption and CO2 emissions at Berlin Airport TXL. By generating ESG reports, it aims to facilitate transparent communication of sustainability standards and targeted measures for controlling energy consumption. The dashboard serves not only for internal process optimization but also for external communication in the InfoCenter for the public. The overarching goal is to create comprehensive transparency and actively contribute to comprehensive ESG goals (Environmental, Social, and Governance).

### What are heat meters?
Heat meters (HM) are devices that measure energy consumption for heating and cooling in buildings. In the context of HeatHub TXL for the former Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL), data from these meters are captured and analyzed. The collected information provides insights into heat consumption in various buildings on the premises. The data not only cover basic energy consumption patterns but also consider factors such as the energy efficiency class of buildings, weather conditions, number of employees, and building size. Through this holistic analysis, HeatHub TXL provides a transparent overview of energy consumption on the airport grounds and contributes to promoting sustainable decisions and measures for energy optimization.
